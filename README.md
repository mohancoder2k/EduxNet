### ‚úÖ Result in GitHub Markdown Preview:

It will render like this in GitHub:

---

#### Response:
- ‚úÖ `"Request sent successfully"`  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è `"Request already exists or already connected"`  
- ‚ùå `"Cannot send request to yourself"`

---

So you're using:
- Emoji ‚úÖ ‚ùå ‚ö†Ô∏è (plain text)
- Response strings inside backticks: `` `"response"` ``

This is **fully GitHub-compatible** Markdown and gives you exactly the style you showed in your screenshot.
